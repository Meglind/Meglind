I'm an illustrator and i pretend to work as a conceptual artist, i do some NSFW art, 3d models, creatures design and Safe art too hehe, 
since i was very young i draw my first creatures, now i'm working on fan projects like the Jienen Region, some Dytish and a few comissions,
i'm going to expand my work to be much professional.
